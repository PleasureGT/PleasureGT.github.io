## Description

This website which I've created contains a landing page which welcomes the user. 

The viewer has then the option to look at my resume. 

Or if he wants to know more about me, he can click on the "About me" button. 

The "Projects" button will redirect the user to my projects which im proud of. 

If they would want to contact me, they can click on the "Contact" button and send a email.
